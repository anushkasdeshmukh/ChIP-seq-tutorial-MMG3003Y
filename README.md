# ChIP-seq-tutorial-MMG3003Y

## ⚙️ Goals
To describe the steps in a typical ChIP-seq analysis workflow. 
To use the SciNet teach cluster to efficiently run a ChIP-seq workflow from sequence reads to peak calls and visualization. 

## 🎯 Project Objective

To demonstrate a step-by-step ChIP-seq analysis comparing CTCF binding between G1E and G1E-ER4 mouse cell lines using chromosome 19 reads. 
The final output includes high-confidence CTCF binding peaks identified using MACS3.

## ✅ SciNet Access

- Must have access to the [SciNet Teach Cluster](https://docs.scinet.utoronto.ca/index.php/Teach_Cluster)
